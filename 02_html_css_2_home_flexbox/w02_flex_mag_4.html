            <h3>BOX-1 ---> 2 Squirrel Web Development as an Industry </h3>
            <p>
                Flying squirrels (scientifically known as Pteromyini or Petauristini) are a tribe of 50 species of
                squirrels in the family Sciuridae. They are not capable of flight in the same way as birds or bats
                but are able to glide from one tree to another with the aid of a patagium, a furry, parachute-like
                membrane that stretches from wrist to ankle. Their long tail provides stability in flight.
                Anatomically they are very similar to other squirrels but have a number of adaptations to suit their
                life style; their limb bones are longer and their hand, foot bones and distal vertebrae are shorter.
                Flying squirrels are able to steer and exert control over their glide path with their limbs and
                tail. Molecular studies have shown that flying squirrels are monophyletic and originated some 18–20
                million years ago. Most are nocturnal and omnivorous, eating fruit, seeds, buds, flowers, insects,
                gastropods, spiders, fungi, bird's eggs and tree sap. The young are born in a nest and are at first
                naked and helpless. They are cared for by their mother and by five weeks are able to practice
                gliding skills so that by ten weeks they are ready to leave the nest. || Flying squirrels

            <h2>BOX-2 ---> 1 Practical Squirrel Web Development</h2>
            <p> Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size
                rodents. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots
                (including woodchucks), flying squirrels, and prairie dogs amongst other rodents. Squirrels are
                indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia.[1] The
                earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene period and are most closely related to the
                mountain beaver and to the dormouse among other living rodent families.
            </p>
            <p> Squirrels are generally small animals, ranging in size from the African pygmy squirrel at 7–10 cm
                (2.8–3.9 in) in length and just 10 g (0.35 oz) in weight, to the Laotian giant flying squirrel at
                1.08 m (3 ft 7 in) in length and the Alpine marmot, which weighs from 5 to 8 kg (11 to 18 lb).
                Squirrels typically have slender bodies with bushy tails and large eyes. In general, their fur is
                soft and silky, though much thicker in some species than others. The coat color of squirrels is
                highly variable between—and often even within—species.[5] In most squirrel species, the hind limbs
                are longer than the fore limbs, while all species have either four or five toes on each paw. The
                paws, which include an often poorly developed thumb, have
                soft pads on the undersides[6] and versatile, sturdy claws for grasping and climbing.[7] Tree
                squirrels, unlike most mammals, can descend a tree head-first. They do so by rotating their ankles
                180 degrees, enabling the hind paws to point backward and thus grip the tree bark from the opposite
                direction.[8] Squirrels live in almost every habitat, from tropical rainforest to semiarid desert,
                avoiding only the high polar regions and the driest of deserts. They are predominantly herbivorous,
                subsisting on seeds and nuts, but many will eat insects and even small vertebrates.[9] As their
                large eyes indicate, squirrels have an excellent sense of vision, which is especially important for
                the
                tree-dwelling species. Many also have a good sense of touch, with vibrissae on
                their limbs as well as their heads.[6] The teeth of sciurids follow the typical rodent pattern, with
                large incisors (for gnawing) that grow throughout life, and cheek teeth (for grinding) that are set
                back behind a wide gap, or diastema.
            </p>
            <p>p3 The living squirrels are divided into five subfamilies, with about 58 genera and some 285
                species.[23] The oldest squirrel fossil, Hesperopetes, dates back to the Chadronian (late Eocene,
                about 40–35 million years ago) and is similar to modern flying squirrels.[24] A variety of fossil
                squirrels, from the latest Eocene to the Miocene, have not be assigned with certainty to any living
                lineage. At least some of these probably were variants of the oldest basal "protosquirrels" (in the
                sense that they lacked the full range of living squirrels' autapomorphies). The distribution and
                diversity of such ancient and ancestral forms suggest the squirrels as a group
                may have originated in North America.[25]
