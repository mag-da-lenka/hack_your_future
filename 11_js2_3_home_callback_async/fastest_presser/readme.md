The fastest presser in this realm
Lets create a fun simple game :)

Here is the setup of the game: Two users compete about who can press a key the most times within a set time!

A user specifies how long time the game should be, and presses "start game!". When the button is pressed it is about pressing either l or s on the keyboard. The user that has the highest number of keypresses after the time is up, wins ðŸŽ‰

Here is a gif of how the site should work:

You can implement it exactly like you want to, but here is my recommended order:

Create an input and a button in html. When the button is clicked, get the value of the input. This value will be the amount of time the game should run.
Set a timeout for the time specified by the user. After that time has run out just log out a simple string.
Create an event listener so you can call a function when any key is pressed. Now grap the actual key that was pressed. Fx was it a j or an i. We are interested in s and l. Here google is your friend!
Keep a counter for how many times l and s was pressed.
Now put it all together! After the timeout is done figure out which of the counters is largest. Give some kind of feedback to the users indicating who won.
Extra features
Start a new game functionality. Create some functionality so that the users can restart a game.
Try and give the site some styling so it looks nice :)
Custom feature. Add something unique to the game! If you dont know how to implement it, just describe what it should do!
Countdown to end of game - optional. Have a countdown that simply counts down until the game is done.
Here are some general things to consider:

What if a user starts pressing a key before the game is started, what should happen?
What if the game is a draw? Are both winners? None winners? Maybe indicate to the user that is was a draw.
What if no time was specified for the game?
What if there were no key presses before the game ends?
Confetti
If you wanna give the game some confetti like in the gif, check out this library
