Create a site where a user can search for any word. When searching a word the application will find a gif using the searched word using the giphy api: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/ Here is how it is going to work: The user can write some text indicating the gif he is looking for, click a button and then a gif will be found (using the searched word) and the gif will be displayed to the user.

Add an input element, where the user can specify how many gif results the user wants.

Try break this problem into smaller problems and write down how you are going to solve the problem BEFORE you start coding.
